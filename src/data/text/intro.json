  "Shortly after the Jordanâ€™s independence in 1946 and the annexation of the West Bank, only a small share of the population (less than half a million) had access to piped water on their premises.",
  "Drinking water was supplied from local springs; there were no sewers and there was little irrigation.",
  "Waves of forced immigrants to Jordan put the country under great pressure in supplying enough water for its population for the years to come.",
  "Jordan needed to build strong institutions with qualified personnel in order to develop its water infrastructure and intelligently use the limited water it had available."
